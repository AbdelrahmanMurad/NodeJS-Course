What is a Router in Express?
A Router in Express helps organize your application, preventing your app.js file from becoming large and hard to manage.
Think of a router as a mini Express application that handles route matching, requests, and responses without starting a separate server or listening on its own port.

Key Features of Express Router:
✅ Uses all HTTP methods like .get(), .post(), .put(), and .delete().
✅ Helps manage incoming requests and directs them to the correct handler.
✅ Created using express.Router().
✅ Routes defined inside a router behave just like those in app.js.
✅ Instead of defining routes in app.js, we group related routes inside a Router file and use app.use() to integrate it.

Router Analogy
A Router is like a group (جروب) of related routes.
It helps structure your Express app by separating concerns.
