Idea of application: user web site
    - we have 3 collections:
        - books
        - reviews
        - reviewers
    - the books have reviews, and the reviews comes from reviewers.
        so, to review we need a reviewer, and thats a user.
    - the user needs an acount.
        - so, you need one more collection named as users. (thats better)
        - or you can store the name & password of users in reviewers.

Steps:
    First: user model
        - name of file start with uppercase: User.js.
        - Why?? Because it will be a class.
        - name of class is name of file. (coding standard عادات برمجية)  
            1. class name{}
            2. constructor(){}
            3. variables inside constructor().
            4. Make an object for the class.
